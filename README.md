# Another Malware Analysis Software

## Purposes of this project are:
1. experimentation with cryptography
2. learning more about developing (web)tools 
3. learning malware analysis
4. self-development


## Process
1. drop the file to AMAS for analysis
2. program calculates the hash of the file(md5, sha1, sha256)
3. compare hashes to a malware hash database
4. see the details about the malware in the browser
